// A goal syntax for boyo
// Keyworks: let print def
// Operators + - *


let A = 0x10 // register, just creates a global variable vector of bytes

print A // keywork print which has IO (not pure functional), prints std::err

def double _a => * 0x10 _a // All operators are polish left handed notation

main double A // Main is the finally run the statement to the right, and returns in std::out

// Prints: 0x100
